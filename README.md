# About me
I'm an Computer Science student specializing in Software Engineering.<br>
I love programming in various languages especialy in `JavaScript`, `ReactJS`, `Python`, `Java`, `SQL` and `C/C++`.<br>
My main career goal is to become a Frontend or Software Developer, and possibly even a Full-Stack Developer.

<br>

## I'm currenly working on:
* Dietician+ ([frontend](https://github.com/BartlomiejJaruga/dietitian-plus-frontend) / [backend](https://github.com/BartlomiejJaruga/dietitian-plus-backend))
* AIComposer - project about generating music with AI using LSTM model and sending generated file to user via website (no repository at this very moment, project still in Requirements Analysis)
* Internet Shop ([frontend](https://github.com/BartlomiejJaruga/internet-shop-frontend) / [backend](https://github.com/BartlomiejJaruga/internet-shop-backend))
* Blood Call - 2D bullet hell game set in a grim dark fantasy realm, developed using the Godot engine. Players are young wizards thrust into relentless action and punishing gameplay, where every encounter tests their reflexes and endurance.

## I'm currently learning:
* Bootstrap
* Spring Boot
* AI models and uses
* Docker (containerization, Docker Hub)
* Pixel-art
